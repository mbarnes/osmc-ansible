# Preference that maps to connman(8) option --nodnsproxy:
#
#   Do not act as a DNS proxy or support external DNS resolving. Depending on
#   how ConnMan is compiled, it will by default direct all DNS traffic to
#   itself by setting nameserver to 127.0.0.1 in resolv.conf(5) file or leave
#   DNS management to an external entity, such as systemd-resolved. If this is
#   not desired and you want that all programs call directly some DNS server,
#   then you can use the --nodnsproxy option. If this option is used, then
#   ConnMan is not able to cache the DNS queries because the DNS traffic is
#   not going through ConnMan and that can cause some extra network traffic.
